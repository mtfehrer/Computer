this project uses a custom ISA but heavily influenced by x86 and ARM
each instruction will be __ bits long
we'll use strings to hold binary information (so we can see it and manage it easily in Python)
the CPU isn't implemented using circuits, but with python so we can use python abstractions for things like adding
